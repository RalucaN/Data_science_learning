# Data science learning resources
This repo contains resources to learn & practice data science. The aim is to include a variety of resources (including courses, tutorials, books, podcasts, blogs, etc) that would support different learning styles.

## Background
Every day, I browse through various articles on Medium and Towards Data Science that cover different topics and perspectives related to data science. I am amazed by the abundance and diversity of resources that are available for anyone who wants to learn more about this field or improve their data & analytics skills. However, I also feel a sense of overwhelm sometimes, as it can be hard to choose what to read or follow among so many options. 

I wanted to create this repo as a way of sharing what inspired me to continue learning and getting better and better every day. The aim is to put together a learning plan that would filter out the noise and focus on the signal, or the most important and practical aspects of data science. By following this plan, I hope to learn new skills, apply them to real-world problems, and grow as a data scientist. I also hope that you will find this plan useful and inspiring for your own learning goals and passions.
